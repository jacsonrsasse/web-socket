# web-socket

## Generic Web Socket

This project is only to create a generic web socket that I can use in other projects if I want to. Initially I will use in a simple chat, and further I'll use in a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

### How to run

Clone this project and run `npm run ci` to restore the `node_modules`

After that, run `npm run dev` to start the server.
